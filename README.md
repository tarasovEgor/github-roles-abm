## 🔍 **Project Goal**

Development of a practical methodology for:

- Identifying GitHub user roles based on their activity and repository artifacts (commits, PRs, issues, reviews).
- Constructing interaction graphs between contributors.
- Analyzing temporal role dynamics.
- Evaluating the applicability of **Conway’s Law** on real GitHub data.
- Developing an **agent-based model (ABM)** that simulates role behavior.
  
Dataset used in the study:

**A Representative User-centric Dataset of 10 Million GitHub Developers**
